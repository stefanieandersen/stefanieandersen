- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stefanieandersen
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in solving genetic puzzles, understanding how things (all the things) work, and getting excited about those things with my friends.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently writing a program to solve A-Puzzle-A-Day which has stumped me since I got it for Christmas.
- ğŸ“« I'm a social yet introverted nerd so email me (effie.andersen@gmail.com) or text me (919.525.8902)
